# Homeworks
You know, sometime in life we need to go to a closed space, with a lot of person in it, where you sit down on a chair and listen to someone all day. That's horrible right ? Since I do some scripts for school, I thought it would be ~~useless~~ useful to publish them here.

## Disclaimers
I made this repo to keep track of my code and how I made it, in no case my goal is to go back to my old code to fix a problem or something I did wrong. I clearly have to improve myself and I surely have improved since I wrote this code.

Also, I'm french wich means my teachers will be correcting my work as a french person, so my comments and variable names may be written in french in most of my commits. I do not intend to translate them.

And finally to every people who followed the same path as me and got the same teachers as me... Well hello there ;D. Seriously, I don't recommend copying my code to see corrections or things like that because I overcomplexified my code and some times added more things than it was asked in the exercises. I can't forbid you from copying it but if you do it, you may face some consequences with the teachers :p

What you may do:
 - Edit the code, correct things up if you want
 - Use some part for your own code

What you may not do:
 - Make pull requests, because as I said I won't correct anything in my previous code.
 - Fully copying it for school purposes, there may be some errors and the teacher can easely determine if the code was copied. I don't want you to mess with your studies because you were too lazy to make your own code
